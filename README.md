# Project Description
This is my first ever React project and personal portfolio webpage built using ReactJS and TailwindCSS. This webpage contains my background, experience, skills, and personal projects that I have developed throughout the past few years in my software development journey. You can find more information about the features of my webpage below as well as all of the different technologies and libraries that I used to create and develop this project.

## Features of the Webpage:
* Website interface built out using the ReactJS library and TailwindCSS framework
* Fully responsive webpage for different screen sizes and mobile adaptability
* Typewriter animation that introduces the user to the project
* Scrolling animations as the user progresses through the webpage
* Ability to send messages and emails through a contact form on the webpage
* A Slideshow/Carousel that allows the user to view and visit the different projects I've done in the past

## Programming Languages and Technologies:
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Animate on Scroll Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)
* [getform](https://getform.io/)
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
